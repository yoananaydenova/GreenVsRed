# GreenVsRed
'Green vs. Red' is a game played on 2D grid that in theory can be infinite (in our case we will assume that x<=y<1000).
Each cell on this grid can be either green (represented by 1) or red (represented by 0). The game always receives an initial state of the grid which we will call 'Generation Zero'. After that a set of 4 rules are applied across the grid and those rules from the next generation.

Rules that create the next generation:
1. Each red cell that is surrounded by exacly 3 or exacly 6 green cells will also become green in the next generation.
2. A red cell will stay red in the next generation if it has either 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 or 8 green neighbours.
3. Each green cell surrounded by 0, 1, 4, 5, 7 or 8 green neighbours will become red in the next generation.
4. A green cell  will stay green in the next generation if it has either 2, 3 or 6 green neighbours.

Important facts:
 - Each cell can be surrounded by up to 8 cells, 4 on the sides and 4 on the corners. Exceptions are the corners and the sides of the grid.
 - All of the 4 rules apply at the same time for the whole grid in order for the next generation to be formed.
 
 YOUR TASK:
 
 Create s program that accepts:
 The size of our grid - x, y (x being the width and y being the height).
 Then the next y lines should contain strings (long x characters) created by 0s and 1s which will represent the 'Generation Zero' state and help us build the grid.
 The last arguments to the program should be coordinates (x1 and y1) and the number N.
 (x1 and y1) wll be coordinates of a cell in the grid. We would like to calculate in how many generations from Generation Zero until generation N this cell was green. (The calculation should include generation Zero and generation N).
 
 Print your result in the console.
 
 EXAMPLE 1:
  - 3x3 grid, in the initial state, the second row is all 1s, how many times will the cell [1, 0](top center) become green in 10 turns?
  
 3, 3
 
 000
 
 111
 
 000
 
 1, 0, 10
 
- expected result: 5
 
 EXAMPLE 2:
  - 4x4  grid. Input:
  
 4, 4
 
 1001
 
 1111
 
 0100
 
 1010
 
 2, 2, 15
 
 - expected result: 14
